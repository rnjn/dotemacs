dotemacs
========
This is a simplistic Emacs setup.  For the last few years (2015-2021) I have been using
Spacemacs and while it still works and I love the mnemonic keys and layered system
it has become a slow, and I am tired of waiting for updates, breaking changes.  This is
an attempt to declutter.  Updating the setup using what's now available in 2021.
In a bind really whether to write literate configuration, choosing a simple single
file for now, to avoid the clutter.
